When creating our interface,
we installed the Python library on our computer in addition to the PyQt5 library and Anaconda libraries.
This is because we designed the interface with the Qt Designer program and wrote and executed our code using Visual Studio Code. If these additional libraries are not currently installed and Visual Studio Code is not used, access to the interface may not be possible.

Operating Systems : Linux Fedora
Functionality
-Our Application has four different pages in interface.
The first three pages list our data separately so providing a convenient division for users.
